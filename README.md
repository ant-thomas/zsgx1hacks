# ZS-GX1 Hacks
Record of attempted hacks on the ZS-GX1 IP Camera

Disclaimer - I'm not a programmer, just a hobbyist that likes poking around with things like this. You use the software here at your own risk, not that there's anything even vaguely risky!

This is a cheap Pan Tilt IP Camera (supposedly 1080p) that for a time was available on Gearbest for around Â£12. I bought 2 in an attempt to hack them as the reason they are so cheap is due to them being locked to paid cloud services.

SOC - GOKE - GK7102

Sensor - SC2135 - supposedly capable of 1080p 30fps

Instructions
* WiFi - setup camera via app
* Ethernet - plug in to network
* Download contents of ```sdcard``` folder to vfat/fat32 formatted microSD card
* Insert microSD card into camera and boot
* Result should be no communication to cloud services, RTSP server on the IP address of the camera

Achieved so far
* ```debug_cmd.sh``` on an SD card enables commands to be run
* Change root password to enable telnet login
* Upgrade busybox
* RTSP server accessible - rtsp://IPADDRESS/ user/pass admin/admin
* Block cloud services via hosts file
* Some GPIO functions found (IR LEDs and IR Cut)

ToDo
* Figure out GPIO control for PTZ, IR and IR Cut, Light sensor
* Change bitrate of RTSP stream
* Get rid of ```p2pcam``` and use an alternative RTSP server
* Add an SSH server (dropbear)
* Add method to use WiFi without first setting up camera via App (possibly by just copying wpa_supplicant file)

2017-10-22 - Update 7 - (DJWillis)

* I am not saying the closed source p2pcam blob looks dodgy or anything but this did make me smile (from ```/home/factory_tool.sh```)

``` 
   #avoid p2pcam auto format tf card!!!
   rm -f /bin/mkdosfs
   rm -f /sbin/mkdosfs
```
That feels like the right way to work around some awesome design considerations :).

2017-10-22 - Update 6 - (DJWillis) 

* Firmware can be updated from a ```firmware.bin``` file on the root of the SD card (formatted vfat). 
   This is a JFFS2 image structured much like other generic cameras based on the GOKE SoC's and a good few better know brands.
  * Suspect this will be distrbuted as one section per partition. With the kernel and uboot not normally being flashed.
  * The tool used to flash the images is ```sdc_tool```.
  * https://github.com/zzerrg/gmfwtools should be usable with the right key and board ident (1003) to unpack and repack the userspace firmware into something we can flash. It may also make cross flashing userspaces possible. Right now however you may well end up with a bricked camera or at least needing serial so try at your own risk.

2017-10-22 - Update 5
* IR Cut and IR LED GPIOs found and controllable
* ```gio -s 40 1``` IR Cut - night
* ```gio -s 40 0``` IR Cut - day
* ```gio -s 46 1``` IR LEDs - on
* ```gio -s 46 0``` IR LEDs - off

2017-10-22 - Update 4
* SD card contents moved to SD card folder
* Updated hosts file included which looks like it prevents the camera from contacting the cloud services. The app shows the camera as disconnected and I'm seeing no activity on my router. RTSP server remains active.

2017-10-22 - Update 3
* RTSP server user/pass - admin/admin - Presents a 1920x1080 12fps stream on rtsp://IPADDRESS/ (no audio)
* Attempted to not run ```p2pcam``` by editing out specific parts of ```start.sh```, this resulting in the WiFi connection not being created. Maybe running ```wpa_supplicant``` via ```debug_cmd.sh``` may fix that.
* As the RTSP server seems to be created by ```p2pcam``` it might be possible to prevent the cloud software communicating outwards by using various hosts file listings.

2017-10-21 - Update 2
* home folder uploaded
* p2pcam.tar.gz is the interesting file - this gets extracted on boot and p2pcam is the camera software.

2017-10-21 - Update 1
* Photos of box and dismantled camera in the photo folder
* Initial process was to download the app via the QR code in the instructions, this gave it WIFI details to logon to, possibly this could be prevented using ethernet. 
  * Update: The need for the app can be bypassed completely by plugging directly into an ethernet connection and not setting up wifi initially as the camera will bring up eth0 via DHCP - Ignore the spoken messages about WiFi.
* Camera dismantled and serial pins found
* Boot output from serial dumped (uploaded)
* The serial interface auto-logs in as root - very useful, but I've been unable to find the root password
* Via serial interface you can add a new user - meaning you can then login via telnet with new user, or change the root password
```
passwd root
```
* /home/start.sh looks for /mnt/debug_cmd.sh which would be placed on a micro SD card - this should be the way to hack the camera.
* Due to the earlier "adduser" or "passwd root" not being persistent through reboots I added the following to debug_cmd.sh
```
(sleep 20 && echo "root:o.eyOMtPAPfbg:0:0:root:/root/:/bin/sh" > /etc/passwd )&
```
* The long sleep is required because the command has to be run after busybox has started - this updates the root password to "root"
* I made a quick attempt to upgrade busybox with a prebuilt binary but the autologin fails on serial - used debug_cmd.sh to copy new version over existing located at /bin/busybox - but having already updated the root password you can login over telnet
* nmap shows the following open ports
```
